> ## Reflection:

This was a 3-week long project. Starting from the day I draw on paper to the day I deployed the project to the internet with a specific domain name.

The goal was to build a personal website (portfolio website) to showcase my projects. And to be a clear example to show my ability to build functioning websites from scratch using `create-react-app`.

This project was an excellent chance to learn new things, by implement many things I have learned from projects tutorials. Such as switching tabs that I used in the “About” Section, Filtering buttons in the “Projects” Section, SVG, and Local Storage.

One of the many challenges I have faced in this project is to deploy the website to the internet, as I had used only free services to deploy my previous projects such as Github Pages and Netlify. So, it was a good experience to learn about host, domain, Cpanel, SSL, and many more.
